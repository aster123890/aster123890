- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, we are from Aster. The case study chosen is Good Health and Well-Being. Hence, we create an apps named IntelliSlim.
- IntelliSlim is an app to help user to encourate user on monitor their healthcare.

- IntelliSlim app provides it user with BMI, Water Tracker, Fasting Tracker, and Pedometer. The BMI module will required user to enter their height and weight. Then, the system will shows the user the categories of their BMI falls in. It is essential to monitor health closely. This awareness highlights the significance of making small changes, such as incorporating regular physical activity and maintaining a balanced diet, to improve overall well-being. Living a healthy life is a journey that requires commitment and meaningful steps.

- Next, the water tracker. The Water Tracker module promotes hydration by reminding users to drink adequate water throughout the day. Staying hydrated is crucial for maintaining energy levels, supporting digestion, and promoting overall health.

- Meanwhile, the Pedometer module encourages physical activity by counting steps and tracking walking patterns, thereby motivating users to increase their daily movement and improve cardiovascular health. This functionality not only aids in weight management but also enhances mood and reduces stress.

- Lastly, the Fasting Tracker module helps users monitor their fasting periods, allowing them to log the start and end times for each fast. By tracking this information, the module promotes structured fasting habits, helping users maintain a consistent schedule and fostering a mindful approach to their eating and health goals.

- The code is written by using Flutter and there are several dependencies used for the developing IntelliSlim app.

- table_calendar (used for user to write the diary on the certain day and have it saved on the day written.
- fl_chart (visualize the tracker such as pedometer, water tracker, fasting tracker)
- sql1 (to connect the flutter with the XAMPP for database)
